#Diabetes Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on clinical and diagnostic data. The project applies various machine learning techniques and provides a full pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment.

Overview
Diabetes is a chronic condition affecting millions worldwide, and early prediction can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project builds a predictive model using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to identify individuals at risk of diabetes.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Analyze and visualize the dataset to identify trends and correlations.

Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing or inconsistent data.
Perform feature scaling and normalization.
Feature engineering for improved model performance.

Model Training:
Implements algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.
Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search or Random Search.

Model Evaluation:
Uses metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC.

Model Deployment:
Flask/FastAPI-based application for real-time diabetes prediction.
